# ASU Pitchfork Font Icon

ASU's pitchfork (shocker) hand sign logo thingy as a font. Originally intended for use with banner and inline marketing material for ASU's Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. 

## Getting Started

Fork or Clone https://github.com/dherbold/asu-pitchfork-font-icon.git

**Local machine use:** 

Install the TTF font for use on your local machine. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: [IcoMoon.io](https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts)

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve this icon selection so you can tweak to taste however you want.

Ive added the original shocker vector file as an additional resource.
